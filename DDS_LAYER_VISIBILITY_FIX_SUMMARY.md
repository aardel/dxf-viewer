# DDS Layer Visibility Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

When loading a DDS file and trying to generate DIN output, the system was throwing an error:
```
Error: Cannot generate DIN: 8 layer(s) are unmapped: 0.00 pt · color null, 2.02 pt · color 90, 1.92 pt · color 100, 3.02 pt · color 166, 1.01 pt · color 163, 1.01 pt · color 101, 3.02 pt · color 200, 2.02 pt · color 164. Please map all layers to line types before generating.
```

This occurred even when:
- ✅ Unmapped layers were unchecked (hidden)
- ✅ Only mapped layers were checked (visible)
- ✅ The system should only process visible layers

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the `validateUnifiedLayerMappings()` function which was incorrectly validating layer mappings:

1. **Wrong Validation Logic**: The function was requiring ALL layers to be mapped, regardless of visibility
2. **Incorrect Error Handling**: The system was throwing errors for unmapped layers even when they were hidden
3. **Missing Visibility Respect**: The validation didn't properly respect the checkbox states in the UI

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Validation Logic**
- **File**: `electron/renderer/renderer.js`
- **Function**: `validateUnifiedLayerMappings()`
- **Change**: Updated validation to only require at least one visible and mapped layer:
  ```javascript
  // Before: valid: unmappedLayers.length === 0 && includedLayers.length > 0
  // After:  valid: includedLayers.length > 0
  ```

### 2. **Updated Error Handling**
- **File**: `electron/renderer/renderer.js`
- **Functions**: `generateDinContentSilently()` and `performDinGeneration()`
- **Change**: Removed error throwing for unmapped layers when they're not visible:
  ```javascript
  // Before: Checked for unmappedLayers.length > 0 and threw error
  // After:  Only check for includedLayers.length === 0
  ```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After these changes:

1. **✅ Hidden Unmapped Layers**: Unchecked/unmapped layers will be ignored during DIN generation
2. **✅ Visible Mapped Layers**: Only checked and mapped layers will be processed
3. **✅ Successful Generation**: DIN generation will work when at least one layer is visible and mapped
4. **✅ Proper Validation**: The system will only validate visible layers, not all layers

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Layer Processing Flow
1. **Visibility Check**: Only process layers where `overlayGroups[key].visible !== false`
2. **Mapping Check**: Only process layers with valid line type mappings
3. **Entity Extraction**: `extractEntitiesFromUnifiedFormat(true)` respects both visibility and mapping
4. **DIN Generation**: Only generates DIN for visible and mapped entities

### Validation Logic
- **Valid**: At least one layer is visible AND mapped
- **Invalid**: No layers are visible and mapped
- **Warning**: Unmapped layers exist (but don't block generation if hidden)

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fix:
1. Load a DDS file (e.g., `test.dds`)
2. Uncheck unmapped layers (they show "UNMAP" in the mapping column)
3. Check only mapped layers (they show a line type name in the mapping column)
4. Click "Generate DIN File" or "Preview DIN"
5. Expected: DIN generation should succeed without errors
