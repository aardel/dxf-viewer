# 📋 Lasercomb DXF Studio - Feature TODO List

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Header Warning & Quick Generate** (HIGH PRIORITY)

### ✅ Status: Not Started
### 🎯 Goal: Streamline workflow with visual feedback and one-click generation

#### 1.1 Warning Symbol in Header
- [ ] Add warning icon (⚠️) component in header
- [ ] Implement mapping completeness detection
- [ ] Color-coded status:
  - 🔴 Red: Missing mappings detected
  - 🟢 Green: All layers mapped
- [ ] Tooltip showing count and list of unmapped layers
- [ ] Icon remains visible when mapping tabs are collapsed
- [ ] Real-time updates when mappings change

#### 1.2 Header Generate DIN Button
- [ ] Add "Generate DIN" button in main header
- [ ] Implement button state logic based on mapping status
- [ ] Success feedback system (animation/message)
- [ ] Error handling for generation failures
- [ ] Integration with existing DIN generation pipeline

#### 1.3 Combined Smart Button Logic
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for button behavior
IF all_layers_mapped:
  Button: "✅ Generate DIN" (enabled, green)
  Action: Generate DIN file instantly
ELSE:
  Button: "⚠️ Missing Mappings" (disabled, amber)  
  Action: Show tooltip with unmapped layers list
```

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `electron/renderer/components/header-controls.js`
- `electron/renderer/components/header-controls.css`
- `electron/renderer/index.html` (header section)

- [ ] Monitoring status display (🟢 Active / 🔴 Inactive)
- [ ] File filtering (only .dxf files)

#### 2.3 Automated Processing Pipeline
```
DXF File Detected → 
Load & Parse → 
Check Layer Mappings → 
IF Complete: Auto-generate DIN → Move to Output
IF Incomplete: Log failure → Keep in Input (with retry option)
```
- [ ] File detection event handlers
- [ ] Automatic DXF parsing and mapping validation
- [ ] Auto-DIN generation for complete mappings
- [ ] File movement/organization system
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic

#### 2.4 Output Folder Management
- [ ] Automatic DIN file placement
- [ ] Configurable naming conventions: `{original_name}.din`
- [ ] Success confirmation system
- [ ] File collision handling (overwrite/rename)

**Files to Create:**
- `electron/renderer/folder-monitor.html`
- `electron/renderer/folder-monitor.js`
- `electron/renderer/folder-monitor.css`
- `electron/renderer/components/folder-picker.js`
- `electron/renderer/components/batch-processor.js`

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Comprehensive Logging System** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### ✅ Status: Not Started
### 🎯 Goal: Complete visibility into automated processing

#### 3.1 Dual Log Windows
**Left Log (Input/Processing):**
- [ ] File detection events with timestamps
- [ ] Processing start/progress indicators
- [ ] Mapping validation results
- [ ] Detailed error messages for failed files
- [ ] Processing time tracking

**Right Log (Output/Success):**
- [ ] Successful DIN generation confirmations
- [ ] Output file locations and details
- [ ] Processing time statistics
- [ ] Export summaries and batch totals

#### 3.2 Advanced Log Features
- [ ] Real-time updates with timestamps
- [ ] Color coding: Success (🟢), Warning (🟡), Error (🔴)
- [ ] Filterable by status type
- [ ] Exportable log files (CSV/TXT)
- [ ] Clear/Reset options
- [ ] Search functionality within logs
- [ ] Log rotation (auto-cleanup old entries)

**Files to Create:**
- `electron/renderer/components/processing-logger.js`
- `electron/renderer/components/log-viewer.css`
- `electron/main/log-manager.js` (IPC handlers)

---

## 🎯 **Phase 4: Advanced Features** (LOW PRIORITY)

### ✅ Status: Not Started
### 🎯 Goal: Enhanced user experience and productivity

#### 4.1 Batch Processing Statistics
- [ ] Files processed counter (session/daily/total)
- [ ] Success/failure ratio displays
- [ ] Average processing time metrics
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Historical data tracking

#### 4.2 Configuration & Settings
- [ ] Auto-processing toggle (enable/disable monitoring)
- [ ] Custom naming patterns for output files
- [ ] Notification settings (sound alerts, visual notifications)
- [ ] Retry logic configuration (attempts, delays)
- [ ] Processing priority settings

#### 4.3 Integration Enhancements
- [ ] Import/export folder configuration presets
- [ ] Preset mapping profiles for common workflows
- [ ] Integration with existing line types and profiles
- [ ] Backup and restore system configurations
- [ ] Multi-profile support for different projects

#### 4.4 Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Dark/light theme support
- [ ] Customizable interface layouts
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Context menus for quick operations
- [ ] Status bar with system information
