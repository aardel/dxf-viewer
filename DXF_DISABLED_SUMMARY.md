# DXF Loading Disabled - Summary

## Overview
DXF file loading has been temporarily disabled to focus on DDS and CF2 format development and testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Dialog Filters (`electron/main/main.cjs`)
- **Before**: `extensions: ['dxf', 'dds', 'cf2', 'cff2']`
- **After**: `extensions: ['dds', 'cf2', 'cff2']`
- **Effect**: File open dialog no longer shows DXF files as supported

### 2. File Loading Logic (`electron/renderer/renderer.js`)
- **Before**: Supported DXF, DDS, and CF2 files
- **After**: Only supports DDS and CF2 files
- **Changes**:
  - Removed DXF/DWG handling in `handleOpenFile()`
  - Updated drag and drop to only accept DDS/CF2 files
  - Updated error messages to indicate DXF is disabled
  - Modified format indicator to default to 'dds' instead of 'dxf'

### 3. Batch Monitor (`electron/renderer/batch-monitor.js`)
- **Before**: Monitored DXF, DDS, and CF2 files
- **After**: Only monitors DDS and CF2 files
- **Effect**: File watcher ignores DXF files

### 4. Unified Importer (`src/parsers/UnifiedImporter.js`)
- **Before**: Supported DXF, DDS, and CF2 parsing
- **After**: DXF parsing throws error, DDS and CF2 work normally
- **Effect**: Attempting to load DXF files shows clear error message

### 5. CAD Viewer (`CAD VIEWER/unified-viewer.html`)
- **Before**: Generic unsupported file message
- **After**: Specific message mentioning DXF is disabled
- **Effect**: Better user feedback when DXF files are attempted

## Testing

### Test Results (`test/dxf-disabled-test.js`)
- ✅ DXF file loading properly blocked with error message
- ✅ DDS file loading works normally
- ✅ CF2 file loading works normally

### Error Messages
- **DXF files**: "DXF support is temporarily disabled. Please use DDS or CF2 files."
- **Other unsupported files**: "Unsupported file type. Only DDS and CF2 files are supported."

## Benefits

1. **Focused Development**: Can concentrate on DDS and CF2 format improvements
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates DXF-related bugs and issues during testing
3. **Clear User Feedback**: Users get explicit messages about DXF being disabled
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All parts of the application consistently reject DXF files

## Re-enabling DXF Support

To re-enable DXF support in the future:

1. **Restore file dialog filters** in `electron/main/main.cjs`
2. **Restore DXF handling logic** in `electron/renderer/renderer.js`
3. **Restore DXF parsing** in `src/parsers/UnifiedImporter.js`
4. **Update batch monitor** to include DXF files
5. **Update CAD viewer** error messages
6. **Test DXF functionality** thoroughly

## Current Supported Formats

- **DDS**: Full support maintained
- **CF2/CFF2**: Full support maintained (with horizontal mirroring fix)
- **DXF**: Temporarily disabled with clear error messages
